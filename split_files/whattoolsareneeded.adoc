== What tools are needed to write in Asciidoc?

A text editor

[%step]
** Vim
** Emacs
** Notepad++
** Atom
** Sublime

[%step]
As long as the editor saves in ascii text (i.e a .docx file will not work) you can use it

[%step]
*_It really is just text!_*

Nice to have:

[%step]
* Syntax Highlighter
* Preview plugin for your browser
* Preview plugin for your editor (if supported)
