== Paragraphs

Paragraphs are separated by blank lines.

[%step]
Write your paragraph sentences on separate lines.

[%step]
* Editing single lines and moving sentences around is easier.
* It is easier to see when you have long sentences.
* Each sentence becomes a string.
* This will help when you're versioning.
* When diffing changes, you don't get massive blocks of text with a one letter change.
* If there are errors when generating a document, finding the line in a paragraph that is causing it is easier. (This is an edge case)
