Images can be added to a document using the image::<filename.jpg>[] attribute.

The images are stored, by default, in the `images` directory relative to the document.
This can be modified by using the  `:imagesdir:` directive and specifying the desired relative path.

The `screenshot` attribute can be used when the `asciidoc-screenshot` extension is installed.
The following code example in a document will take a screenshot of the Google France lading page when the document is rendered.

Using the `asciidoc-image-helper` plugin for the Atom editor allows for pasting images from the clipboard into the current document.
When pasted, the image file is created in the `images` directory (by default) with the name of the document and a random hash as the filename. The `image::` attribute with this filename is created within the doc.
