== Introduction

These are notes about the presentation I gave to to http://calug.org[Columbia Area Linux User Group] about http://asciidoc.org[Asciidoc] and http://asciidcotor.org[Asciidoctor].
The presentation source files themselves are shared in the {sifile}[single_file] and {spfile}[split_files] directories.
The talking points I used during the presentation were developed as I wrote the presentation and as I went along.

== What files are here

In the {sifile}[single_file] directory is the {sifile}/asciidoctor_presentation_calug_final.html[asciidoctor_presentation_calug_final.html] which is the final html file I used to present from.
The final presentation file was generated from the {sifile}/asciidoctor_presentation_calug.adoc[asciidoctor_presentation_calug.adoc] file in the {sifile}[single_file] directory using the following code.

[source]
----
asciidoctor -T ./asciidoctor-deck.js/templates/haml/ -b deckjs asciidoctor_presentation_calug.adoc -o asciidoctor_presentation_calug_final.html
----

The {sifile}[single_file] directory contains the presentation adoc file in one large file with all the chapters included.
The {spfile}[split_files] directory contains the presentation file broken down into its chapters, with the {spfile}/asciidoctor_presentation_calug_multi.adoc[asciidoctor_presentation_calug_multi.adoc] file acting as the index file.
There are a few small differences in order between the single and multi files, but they are essentially the same content.

Assuming Asciidoctor has been installed on your system, running the following command will generate a HTML page from the {sifile}[single_file] directory

asciidoctor asciidoctor_presentation_calug.adoc

Running the following command will generate a HTML page from the {spfile}[split_files] directory
